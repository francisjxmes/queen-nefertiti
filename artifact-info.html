        <h2>Relief of <span>Queen Nefertiti</span></h2>

        </small>

        <p>
          This relief block shows the queen wearing an elaborate wig surmounted by what was originally a towering
          crown of uraei, sun disk,
          two cow horns, and two feathers. Her arm is raised in offering to the Aten. The queen's image is depicted,
          with a drooping chin,
          thin slanted eyes, and a sharply angled nose and brow similar to that is seen in depictions of her husband
          in an exaggerated style
          seen in some earlier of Amarna art (see 66.99.40).
        </p>
        <p>
          As Marianne Eaton-Krauss, a specialist in Amarna art, has recently pointed out,
          the traces of the Aten rays around the queen'fs face and arms indicate the disk
          was almost directly overhead. The queen must have stood alone, without her husband,
          beneath the rays. She would have been followed by a small figure of her eldest daughter,
          labeled in the column of hieroglyphs behind her head. The unusual arrangement is known from the pylons of
          the early
          Temple of the Benben at Karnak, and from some enigmatic structures known as the Pillars of Nefertiti.
          The relief may well have originated in one of these structures.

        <p>
          This torso of Nefertiti was found in the Sanctuary of the Great Aten Temple
          or in the dump south of the Sanctuary area of the temple. It was part of a dyad of the
          king and queen standing together and holding in front of them a wide stela with names of the Aten.
          The queen's left arm was bent and she held her hand against the side of the stela.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nefertiti wears a revealing smooth garment leaving one shoulder bare.
          Over that she has a pleated shawl whose short loop edge can be seen crossing between her
          breasts to the point where the shawl tied beneath the right breast.

        </small>

        <p>
          The Head of Akhenaten or Nefertiti, is a gypsum plaster sculpture from the Amarna Period.
          It exemplifies the artistic style of the time, characterized by androgynous features and refined
          craftsmanship.
          Found in the sculptors' workshops at Amarna, its identity as Akhenaten or Nefertiti remains debated.

        <h2><span>Finger Ring</span> depicting King <span>Akhenaten and Queen Nefertiti</span> as Shu and Tefnut</h2>

        </small>

        <p>
          This ring was found at Amarna. The hieroglyphs may be read as an ideogram.
          The two seated figures are probably Akhenaten (left) and Nefertiti (right) as the deities
          Shu (air as indicated by the feather he holds) and Tefnut (moisture).
          They were father and mother of the earth and sky, which are symbolically represented by the earth hieroglyph
          (below)
          and by the sun disk flanked by two sacred cobras (above).

        <p>
          This bottle is decorated with the inlaid cartouches of Akhenaten and Nefertiti.
          The forms of their names indicate that the bottle was made in the later years of the king's reign,
          when he resided at Amarna. Bottles of this type appear on stands in the banquet and palace storehouse
          scenes depicted in the tombs at Amarna. These vessels show the skill with which the faience workers of
          Amarna were able to produce large objects as well as smaller pieces, such as jewelry and inlays.

        <p>
          A narrowed banded eye evoking a trance-like gaze is preserved on this fragment of a statuary.
          The fragment is carved in the indurated limestone that is so characteristic of the Amarna temples.
          From the fragment it is not possible to say whether Akhenaten or Nefertiti is actually represented,
          and often even much larger fragments pose problems of identification since the king and queen were closely
          twinned.

        alt="Limestone Block Depicting a Queen Offering to the Aten" 
        class="queen-offering-artifact">

        <small>
          New Kingdom, Amarna Period - ca. 1345-1335 BCE -
          On View at The Met Fifth Avenue in Gallery 131
        </small>

        <p>
          This limestone block is from a monumental temple scene representing the king and queen makinig an offering
          to Aten.
          The face, usually identified as Akhenaten, actully depicts an Amarna queen, probably Nefertiti, following
          her husband.
          The king's shoulder is just visible at the left side of the block. Nefertiti wears the royal "afnet"
          headcloth with a uraeus cobra at the forehead.
          Two of Aten's hands hold an ankh to her nose and mouth. The hand at the end of a third ray is turned upward
          to touch the divine cobra on the queen's forehead.
          This reversal of the hand position is unusual but not unprecedented, and adds an element of artistic tension
          to the composition.
        </p>
        <p>
          The relief has been carved in the restrained style that came into use in about the eights year of
          Akhenaten's reign,
          shortly after the capital was moved to Tell el-Amarna (Akhetaten). The delicacy of the modeling, which
          subtly emphasizes the bones of the lower jaw, cheek, and brow,
          suggests that the face was carved by a master craftsman.

        <p>
          This graceful, translucent drinking cup in the form of a white lotus blossom is treasured both for its
          beauty and its historical interest.
          The throne name (Nefer-kheperu-Re, beloved of Re) and personal name of Amenhotep IV are inscribed in the
          small panel on the side, between two cartouches
          surrounding the early titulary of the Aten (left) and a cartouche naming the principal queen, Nefertiti
          (right). Thus, the vessel must have been made before Year 5 of the king's reign,
          when he changed his name to Akhenaten.

        <p>
          This sculptural piece captures the naturalistic depiction of the queen's thighs, reflecting the artistic
          style of the Amarna Period.
          The fragment's dimensions are approximately 23.5 cm in height, 28 cm in width, and 9 cm in depth.
          It was excavated from the Great Temple of the Aten in Amarna during the 1891–92 Petrie/Carter excavations.
          The artifact was acquired by The Met in 1921 as a gift from Edward S. Harkness.
          This piece offers insight into the period's emphasis on naturalistic and individualized royal portraits.

          The Mouth of Akhenaten or Nefertiti is a red quartzite fragment from the New Kingdom's Amarna Period.

          This block depicts the large hip and buttocks of a female, identifiable by her garment and the curve of her
          thigh against her stomach. The relative size of the figure indicates the queen is represented. Two men kiss
          the ground in her
          presence while clutching the handles of their insignia, followed by a row of three ladies-in-waiting.

        <img id="artifact-12" src="assets/images/tablet-akhen-and-nefertiti-card.jpg"
        alt="Tablet with Cartouches of Aten, Akhenaten and Nefertiti">

        <small>
          New Kingdom, Amarna Period - ca. 1353-1336 BCE -
          On View at The Met Fifth Avenue in Gallery 122
        </small>

        <p>
          The Tablet with Cartouches of Aten, Akhenaten, and Nefertiti is an ancient
          Egyptian artifact from the New Kingdom's Amarna Period. Carved from yellow quartzite,
          this tablet features the cartouches—oval hieroglyphic inscriptions—of the sun deity Aten, Pharaoh Akhenaten,
          and Queen Nefertiti.
          These cartouches symbolize the religious reforms of Akhenaten, who established Atenism, a monotheistic
          worship of the sun disk Aten.
        </p>
        <p>
          The tablet's dimensions are approximately 13.7 cm in height, 13.5 cm in width, and 5.8 cm in depth. It was
          excavated from Amarna,
          the capital city founded by Akhenaten, during the 1891–92 excavations led by archaeologists Flinders Petrie
          and Howard Carter.
          The artifact was later acquired by The Met in 1921 as a gift from Edward S. Harkness. This artifact provides
          insight into the religious and
          artistic transformations during Akhenaten's reign, highlighting the prominence of Aten and the royal family
          in the period's iconography.
