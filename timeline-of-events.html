        <h2>ca. 1370 BCE - <span>Birth of Nefertiti</span></h2>
        <p>
          Nefertiti was likely born around 1370 BCE, 
          though the exact year and location remain uncertain. 
          Some scholars speculate she may have foreign origins, 
          possibly from the Mitanni kingdom in the Near East, 
          based on inscriptions and certain artistic styles. Her name, 
          which translates to "The Beautiful One Has Come," highlights 
          her renowned beauty, later immortalized in one of the most famous 
          depictions of ancient Egypt.
        </p>
        <h2>ca. 1350 BCE - Marriage to <span>Pharaoh Akhenaten</span></h2>
        <p>
          Around 1350 BCE, Nefertiti married Akhenaten, previously known as Amenhotep IV, 
          the ruler of Egypt. Akhenaten is best known for shifting from the traditional worship 
          of multiple Egyptian gods to the exclusive worship of Aten, the sun disk, as the supreme 
          deity. As his Great Royal Wife, Nefertiti played a significant role in supporting these 
          religious changes, often appearing alongside Akhenaten in artwork, performing rituals, 
          and offering tributes to Aten. Their partnership was key to the cultural and ideological 
          transformations of their era.
        </p>
        <h2>ca. 1348-1346 BCE - Prominent Role in <span>Religious</span> and <span>Political Affairs</span></h2>
        <p>
          During the early years of Akhenaten’s rule, Nefertiti was more than a royal consort; 
          she held considerable influence in Egypt’s religious and political spheres. 
          In art, she is frequently portrayed as nearly equal to Akhenaten, taking part in 
          religious ceremonies and state events. This level of prominence suggests she had substantial 
          authority, with some theories proposing that she may have co-ruled with Akhenaten during this 
          time.
        </p>
        <h2>ca. 1346 BCE - Nefertiti's <span>Co-Regency</span> with Akhenaten</h2>
        <p>
          By approximately 1346 BCE, Nefertiti’s power appears to have increased even further.
          Evidence from inscriptions suggests she might have become a co-regent alongside Akhenaten, 
          assuming some of the responsibilities of a pharaoh. Depictions of her wearing the pharaoh’s 
          crown and participating in governance lend support to the idea that she may have served as Akhenaten’s 
          equal during his reign, possibly stepping into a leadership role during periods of his illness or absence.
        </p>
        <h2>ca. 1345 BCE - Birth of Nefertiti's <span>Daughters</span></h2>
        <p>
          Nefertiti and Akhenaten had six daughters, including Meritaten, Meketaten, and Ankhesenpaaten 
          (later known as Ankhesenamun), who frequently appeared in the art of the period. These daughters were central 
          figures in royal imagery, often shown in intimate, family-oriented scenes that emphasized Nefertiti’s role as a mother. 
          Their upbringing likely combined political training and religious significance, preparing them to uphold their parents’ 
          reformist legacy.
        </p>
        <h2>ca. 1338 BCE - The Rise of <span>Smenkhkare</span></h2>
        <p>
          During the latter years of Akhenaten’s reign, a mysterious figure named Smenkhkare appeared in the historical record. 
          Some researchers suggest that Smenkhkare might have been Nefertiti ruling under a new name, or possibly one of her daughters, 
          such as Meritaten, taking on the role of pharaoh. This theory stems from references to a female ruler associated with Smenkhkare, 
          who either co-ruled briefly with Akhenaten or succeeded him after his death. Nefertiti’s sudden absence from 
          records during this time adds to the speculation that she may have adopted this male royal title.
        </p>
        <h2>ca. 1336 BCE - Death of<span>Akhenaten</span></h2>
        <p>
          Akhenaten’s reign ended around 1336 BCE, though the cause of his death is unknown. 
          His passing marked the end of the religious revolution he had initiated. After his death, Egypt experienced political 
          and religious instability, and his successor, the young Tutankhamun, began to reverse many of his reforms. Nefertiti’s 
          role during this transitional period remains unclear, but it is possible she continued to exert influence, particularly 
          if she was connected to Smenkhkare’s brief reign.
        </p>
        <h2>ca. 1335 BCE - <span>Nefertiti's Disappearance</span> from Historical Records</h2>
        <p>
          After Akhenaten’s death, Nefertiti seemingly vanished from historical and archaeological records. Her name no 
          longer appeared in inscriptions or monuments, prompting various 
          theories about her fate. Some believe she died shortly after Akhenaten, while others propose she withdrew 
          from public life or continued to wield influence during Tutankhamun’s early reign. Her disappearance has led to speculation t
          hat she might have been marginalized or that she assumed a different role, possibly ruling Egypt under the name Smenkhkare.
        </p>
        <h2>ca. 1332 BCE - Death of<span>Nefertiti?</span></h2>
        <p>
          The date of Nefertiti’s death is highly uncertain, with some scholars suggesting she may have died around 1332 BCE. 
          Since her name is absent from records after Akhenaten’s death, it is unclear whether she died before Tutankhamun 
          became pharaoh or if she quietly retained influence during his reign.
        </p>
        <h2>1912 - The Discovery of <span>Nefertiti's Bust</span></h2>
        <p>
          In 1912, archaeologists unearthed the iconic limestone bust of 
          Nefertiti at the ruins of Amarna. Now housed in the Egyptian Museum of Berlin, 
          the bust has become one of ancient Egypt’s most recognizable artifacts, symbolizing both Nefertiti’s 
          beauty and the artistic innovations of the Amarna period. Its discovery revived academic interest in her life and reign, 
          though much about her political role and ultimate fate remains unresolved.
        </p>
        <h2>Modern Legacy and <span>Controversies</span></h2>
        <p>
          Nefertiti’s legacy is both enduring and multifaceted. In modern times, she has become a symbol of beauty and power, 
          representing the cultural and political upheavals of the Amarna period. Her iconic bust continues to fascinate people worldwide. 
          However, much of her life remains shrouded in mystery. Some theories suggest she may have ruled as pharaoh after Akhenaten’s death, 
          possibly as Smenkhkare, while others argue she influenced Egypt through her daughters and political networks. Her role in Akhenaten’s 
          religious reforms was pivotal, though the extent of her direct involvement is still debated.
